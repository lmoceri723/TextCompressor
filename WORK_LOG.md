| 12/2  |  2:00-2:30  |                                                                                                                                                                                                  I listened to Mr. Blick's presentation on the problem set. We spent about 10-15 mins afterwards brainstorming solutions on the whiteboard. |
| 12/2  |  2:30-3:00  |                                                                                                                          I spent this time brainstorming a solution where I would use a hashmap to store common sequences of characters and then replace them with shorter codes. I cloned the repository and started making a mental plan. |
| 12/4  | 12:35-1:05  |                                                I discussed the problem with my classmates, brainstormed solutions, and then wrote out a plan for compressing. I plan to find the most repeated sequences in the full text (maybe I'll limit to some percent if it takes too long), then I'll use those to make codes that can replace them. |
| 12/4  |  1:05-1:45  |                                                                                                                                                                      I started to write my compress method and am halfway done with creating my dictionary with the codes. I just need to find the 256 most common ones, and then build it. |
| 12/5  | 9:50-10:20  | I did some research on stack overflow and learned how to use the java sort method to sort my dictionary values in descending order so that I could have the 256 most repeated patterns. I then implemented it in code. I have finished buildTable, which does most of the work for compress. Now I just need to finish comrpess and expand. |
| 12/5  | 10:20-10:50 |                                                                                                         I realized that I didn't actually have a working compress function. I forgot to write the non-code portions of the data. I fixed this issue, and wrote expand. I started testing it but I have bugs that I haven't yet figured out. |
| 12/10 |  8:55-9:25  |                                                                                                                                                I listened to Mr. Blick's presentation on the edge case, and then I started coding the compress method. I believe it will be fully working, and I just now have to write expand and test it. |
| 12/10 |  9:25-9:55  |                                                                                                      I started out by fixing my broken github, which took a bit of time away. Then, I realized that I was never writing out EOF and closing, so I did that in compress. Then I got started on writing expand, and I'm about 20% or so done. |
